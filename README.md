# Probability and Statistics Web Tool

This repository contains a web-based statistics tool developed as a university project for a Probability and Statistics course. The tool provides essential statistical computations and visualizations, including data distribution analysis, probability distributions, and simple linear regression.

## Features
### 1. Data Distribution Analysis
- Calculate mean, median, and mode
- Identify box plot values (quartiles, interquartile range, and outliers)
- Detect outliers in a dataset

### 2. Probability Distributions
- Binomial Distribution: Compute probabilities and visualize the distribution
- Hypergeometric Distribution: Calculate probabilities and plot results
- Poisson Distribution: Evaluate probabilities and generate a probability mass function (PMF) plot

### 3. Simple Linear Regression
- Compute correlation coefficient
- Generate regression line model
- Visualize scatter plot with the regression line

## Notes
This project was also created when I had just learned about front-end development. This project is not 100% complete, and there are no plans to finish it, as the university course has already been completed. Therefore, further development or maintenance is not intended.
